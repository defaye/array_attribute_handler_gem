# ArrayAttributeHandler

ArrayAttributeHandler is a simple Ruby gem designed to facilitate the management of array attributes in Rails-based applications.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add array_attribute_handler
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install array_attribute_handler
```

For those wanting the cutting-edge version or for specific branches, you can specify the GitHub repo in your Gemfile:

```bash
gem 'array_attribute_handler', git: 'https://github.com/defaye/array_attribute_handler_gem.git'
```

## Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use the gem will be provided soon. For now, refer to the documentation and examples within the code.

## Development

Interested in contributing or diving deep into the code? Here's how you can get started:

1. Clone the repository.
1. Execute `bin/setup` to set up the development environment.
1. Use `rake spec` to run the test suite and ensure everything works as expected.
1. `bin/console` provides an interactive console for experimentation.

To install the development version of the gem on your local machine:

```bash
bundle exec rake install
```

When it's time to cut a new release:

1. Update the version number in version.rb.
1. Use bundle exec rake release to handle the rest. This will tag the version, push changes and tags to the repository, and release the gem version on RubyGems.org.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
